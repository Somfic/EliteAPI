EliteAPI's goal is to greatly reduce the time it takes for programmers to hook into the game by doing all the parsing and deserializing of the Elite: Dangerous log files for you, leaving you to fully focus on your application. 

EliteAPI currently supports all *180* possible events, as well as *real time tracking* of items like the landing gear, cargo scoop, night vision, mass lock, etc, which are all available in VoiceAttack and VoiceMacro from the get-go. It also has an *[Inara](https://inara.cz/inara-api/) API* and *[Discord Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence) client* built in. As stated before EliteAPI comes as both a .NET library as a VoiceAttack & VoiceMacro plugin, giving you a lot of possibilities to create tools you otherwise would need months for to create.

The project is completely open-source and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/EliteAPI/EliteAPI). The .NET library currently has more than 2,000 downloads on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EliteAPI/) already!

- You can download the *.NET library* via [GitHub](https://github.com/EliteAPI/EliteAPI/releases) or [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EliteAPI/).
- You can download the *VoiceAttack plugin* (codename *EliteVA*) via [GitHub](https://github.com/EliteAPI/EliteAPI/releases) (*EliteVA-setup.exe*).
- You can download the *VoiceMacro plugin* (codename *EliteMacro*) via [GitHub](https://github.com/EliteAPI/EliteAPI/releases) (*EliteMacro-setup.exe*) (***Requires beta version +1.3.x***).
